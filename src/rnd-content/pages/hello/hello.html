<h2>Based on W3Schools lessons!</h2>
<p>W3Schools is the best online portal to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScripts. Default RND Framework follows W3.CSS styles & standards that you can easily change as your project needs.</p>
   
<p>Any <mark>w3-class-name</mark> can be used in RND Framework by replacing prefixes as <mark>rnd-class-name</mark>. <br>For example, <mark>w3-container</mark> class is used to create a container in w3schools. In RND Framework, we use <mark>rnd-container</mark> class to achieve it.</p>

      <h3>Layouts</h3>      
    <p>Layouts are just like child-templates which are independent from the main template. You can create/edit them to render special pages in your project. And also you can transfer them to other projects easily. For example, if you create a layout that has a contact form, you can easily copy/paste it to other RND websites and render the contact form ASAP. No need to worry about editing styles, or matching containers.</p>

      <h3>Plugins</h3>
    <p>Registering a new user, logging in to the dashboard are technical functions which need programming skills. RND Framework simply uses plugins to achieve these difficult tasks and it helps beginners to avoid bugs, security and performance issues on their websites. Plugins are also moveable, so you can use them in your other RND websites easily. </p>
